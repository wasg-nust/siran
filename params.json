Creation of these rules is dependent on user experience and exposure; however; even subject to availability of ideal knowledge there is no guarantee that rules being fed are formally correct to detect latest threat for which they have been designed. It could end as futile effort or more towards false positive results. The main driving force for a firewall, Antivirus Solution or any other security product is its signature or mechanism through which it claims its effectiveness.  If this seed has a flaw in its anatomy, fruitful results would always be awaited and will affect the cost of starvation of reputation, revenue and services as well.\r\n\r\n## Siran\r\nOur solution to improve the usability of developing and deploying _Web Application Firewall_ rules by allowing easy management, searching, analysis, translation and classification of firewall rules.
